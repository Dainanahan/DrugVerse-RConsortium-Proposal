# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->
The drugverse series of packages would all be successfully uploaded to CRAN, and a Shiny R server that is using drugverse would be hosted on Shiny's hosting service (R Studio).

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->
- The packages would easily accessible and downloadable from CRAN
- The users of drugverse and/or its Shiny R server would be able to provide us with feedback via drugverse's GitHub pages and via email
- Many users would fork/star drugverse's repository on GitHub as well as submitting pull requests to be approved
- We will have published a few papers on the different features provided in drugverse
- Users of drugverse would cite our papers in their work

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->
We have the following short-term objectives in mind: 

- Conduct further research into taking advantage of heterogeneous information sources for enhancing the accuracy of the different prediction algorithms.
- Further our self-branding on social media (LinkedIn, ResearchGate, etc.) to improve our reach as well as attend conferences to show our work (see next section for more details).
- Make use of ensemble learning and deep learning to further improve accuracy of the prediction models.
- Utilizing Big Data technologies and tools in order to support the huge amounts of data that we will eventually be dealing with.
- Conduct a search for individuals who are willing to contribute to drugverse and who preferably possess a background in pharmaceuticals.


## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->
- It would hurt the project, if people who are working on it (especially the full-timers) leave for whatever reason.
- Some of the employees reside in other countries and communicating with them may not always be efficient online.
- Untimely delivery of drugverse's tools
- Costs of salaries and web-hosting services might not be adequately covered by the provided funds,
