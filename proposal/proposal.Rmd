# The proposal
<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined. 
-->

DrugVerse provides pharmaceutical researchers with different tools that mimic the data science life cycle and helps them to achieve their missions in solving challenges pertaining to drug development.


## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->

Following is what DrugVerse would be capable of doing upon its completion:

- wrangle data obtained from different drugs-related data sources and formats into forms that are more analysis-ready under R,
- explore and mine drugs-related data in Shiny applications containing user-friendly interfaces and interactive visualizations,
- run prediction algorithms (e.g. similarity based algorithms, feature based algorithms, semantic based algorithms, etc) for the prediction of different associations (e.g. drug-target interactions, drug-disease associations, etc.)
- validate prediction results both quantitatively (via latest known statistical validation methods) and qualitatively (e.g. viewing highest-ranked predictions and highlighting those that are already known in the literature) in intuitive and easy-to-understand reports.


Following the development of DrugVerse:

- The R community would benefit from packages that perform data retrieval, data wrangling and building prediction models for drug development 
- Practitioners in drug discovery would benefit from visualization facilities provided in DrugVerse that would enable them to explore data in an interactive manner
- Practitioners would also be provided with facilities to implement cross validation strategies for use in drug discovery efforts

 - [ ] Architecture
 - [ ] Assumptions

dbparser (currently at version 1.0.4, updated regularly)
The main purpose of the R package, DrugBank Parser, is to parse the DrugBank database which is downloadable in XML format into more than 75 R dataframes. These dataframes can then be explored and analyzed as desired by the user. This package further provides the facility of saving the parsed data into a given database (e.g. MySQL).
DrugMiner (under development)
DrugMiner is a complete R Shiny application that can be used to do the following:
Displaying an interactive drug-target network.
Augmenting the visualized network with drug-enzyme, drug-transporter and drug-carrier relations.
Selecting certain drugs to perform specific tasks on them using one of the other tools that are available in DrugVerse such as the Drug-Target Interaction Predictor (see below).
Drug Target Interaction Predictor (under development)
Drug-Target Interaction Predictor is a package that provides implementations of different algorithms for predicting drug-target interactions. These algorithms can be categorized as follows:
Similarity-based methods
Bipartite local models
Matrix factorization methods
Feature-based methods
Network-based methods
Byakugan (in planning phase, development to commence shortly)
Byakugan is a complete R Shiny application that provides the following features:
Extracting pharmacological information of drugs and biomedical documents using NLP and text mining techniques from different online resources to find implicit co-occurrent compoundâ€“protein relations.
Building its own knowledge base from the extracted information
Answering queries about drugs and targets based on the knowledge parsed from the different data sources (e.g. article abstracts, online biological databases, RDF databases, etc.)
