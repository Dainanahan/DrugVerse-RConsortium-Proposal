**DrugVerse** provides pharmaceutical researchers with different tools that mimic the data science life cycle and helps them to achieve their missions in solving challenges pertaining to drug development.

Following is what **DrugVerse** would be capable of doing after its completion:


- wrangle data obtained from different drugs-related data sources and formats into forms that are more analysis-ready under R,
- explore and mine drugs-related data in Shiny applications containing user-friendly interfaces and interactive visualizations,
- run prediction algorithms (e.g. similarity based algorithms, feature based algorithms, semantic based algorithms, etc) for the prediction of different associations (e.g. drug-target interactions, drug-disease associations, etc.)
- validate prediction results both quantitatively (via latest known statistical validation methods) and qualitatively (e.g. viewing highest-ranked predictions and highlighting those that are already known in the literature) in intuitive and easy-to-understand reports.
